# K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

The project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm in Python. By analyzing features like Annual Income and Spending Score, the dataset is segmented into distinct groups. Key steps include data preprocessing, determining optimal clusters using the Elbow Method, training the K-Means model, and visualizing the clusters. This approach helps businesses identify customer segments for personalized marketing strategies.
